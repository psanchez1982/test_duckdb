       "Summary: [[\"Elden Ring is a fantasy, action and open world game with RPG elements such as stats, weapons and spells. Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between.\",\"A rogue-lite hack and slash dungeon crawler in which Zagreus, son of Hades the Greek god of the dead, attempts to escape his home and his oppressive father by fighting the souls of the dead through the various layers of the ever-shifting underworld, while getting to know and forging relationships with its inhabitants.\",\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the first 3D open-world game in the Zelda series. Link can travel anywhere and be equipped with weapons and armor found throughout the world to grant him various bonuses. Unlike many games in the series, Breath of the Wild does not impose a specific order in which quests or dungeons must be completed. While the game still has environmental obstacles such as weather effects, inhospitable lands, or powerful enemies, many of them can be overcome using the right method. A lot of critics ranked Breath of the Wild as one of the best video games of all time.\",\"A small child falls into the Underground, where monsters have long been banished by humans and are hunting every human that they find. The player controls the child as they try to make it back to the Surface through hostile environments, all the while engaging with a turn-based combat system with puzzle-solving and bullet hell elements, as well as other unconventional game mechanics.\",\"A 2D metroidvania with an emphasis on close combat and exploration in which the player enters the once-prosperous now-bleak insect kingdom of Hallownest, travels through its various districts, meets friendly inhabitants, fights hostile ones and uncovers the kingdom's history while improving their combat abilities and movement arsenal by fighting bosses and accessing out-of-the-way areas.\",...,\"Back to the Future: The Game is one of Telltale Games' popular episodic games. It follows the story of the famous Marty McFly and Doc Brown as they stumble through another adventure in time. It is broken into 5 episodes, and incorporates Telltale's unique spin on point-and-click games.\",\"Team Sonic Racing combines the best elements of arcade and fast-paced competitive style racing as you face-off with friends in intense multiplayer racing.\",\"Set in a huge open world, Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen presents a rewarding action combat experience. Players embark on an epic adventure in a rich, living world with three AI companions, known as Pawns. These partners fight independently, demonstrating prowess and ability that they have developed based on traits learnt from each player. PC users can share these Pawns online and reap rewards of treasure, tips and strategy hints for taking down the terrifying enemies. Pawns can also be borrowed when specific skills are needed to complete various challenging quests.\",\"An ancient evil has returned to Baldur's Gate, intent on devouring it from the inside out. The fate of Faerun lies in your hands. Alone, you may resist. But together, you can overcome.\",\"Join Emmet and an unlikely group of resistance fighters in their heroic quest to thwart Lord Business' evil plans - a mission that Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously unprepared for. It's a wild ride with a surprising mix of over 90 playable characters including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, the Green Ninja, Gandalf, Shakespeare, Cleopatra and more.\"]]\n",

The art is technically good but the aesthetic does very little for me, too clean or something. idk wish I liked it but I do not', 'incredible art, a banger soundtrack a surprisingly charming storyline and a big red dog. hades has very smooth gameplay but after playing it for a while it just feels like youre doing the same 3 hit combo ove and over again, which dont get me wrong that combo feels great to do but once i becomes muscle memory you kinda go into autopilot. also i think the boons are cool but i would like to see them change the flow of combat a bit more, there are some cool ones like the grape boon that can change the way you play but most of them are just upgrades that dont really change the gameplay or strategy. other then those 2 small gripes the game is fantastic.', \"People tell me this game gets really really good at some point but i've beaten entire games in the amount of time I gave this game.\", 'Não sou muito de jogo indie, admito que joguei poucos, mas devo dizer que Hades foi um dos melhores jogos que joguei na vida, facilmente no top 15. Toda sua arte, dublagem, gameplay, carisma dos personagens, é tudo incrivel', \"I can't shake the feeling that I am thoroughly bored playing Hades. I've picked up Hades three times over the last few years, and three times I've found myself putting down the controller after a handful of hours, especially after reaching the third stage, and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for me. After giving it a few good goes, I've finally managed to pin down what it is that just doesn't click for me about Hades.\", 'One of my favorites in the rogue-likes/lites, only being beat by binding of Isaac.

No estoy ni cerca de conseguir el 100%, tengo mas de 100 horas y aún estoy descubriendo cosas nuevas. Va más allá de un simple juego, es una experiencia que lamentablemente solo se puede vivir una vez en la vida y la recomiendo totalmente.', 'em meio a tanto jogo de mundo aberto ruim saindo por aí na última década, acho que da pra entender porque breath of the wild chocou tanto as pessoas no ano em que ele lançou. E realmente eu acho que é o melhor mundo aberto que eu já joguei até hoje, explorar cada pedacinho desse mundo é TÃO GOSTOSO, parece que tudo aqui tá no mapa tem um propósito para estar lá, diferente dos mapas vazios da ubisoft por exemplo.

Klar, die Puzzles dieses Point and Click Adventures von Telltale sind super einfach, aber ich bin hier wegen der Story und die wurde in meinen Augen gelungen weitergeführt. Ein Trumpf ist auch, dass Christopher Lloyd als Doc Brown zurückkehrt und die englische Stimme von Marty unfassbar nah an Michael J. Fox ist.
